	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>In computer science, the Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity  and its efficient is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.</p>
	<p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>Space Complexity</b>  and O(n) is best time complexityof the algorithm.</p>
